# Qudit Simulator — Exact & Hyperscale

This project is a **quantum qudit simulator** implemented in HTML/JavaScript.  
It supports two modes:

- **Exact Product-State Engine**: Models qudits with randomized single-site unitaries.
- **Hyperscale Summary Mode**: Approximates entanglement growth and system capacity for up to 1000×1000 dimensions.

### Features
- Adjustable number of qudits (N) and levels per qudit (d).
- Visualization of marginal distributions and entropy scaling.
- Real-time calculation of Hilbert space dimension, memory usage, and state probabilities.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Quantum computing concepts (Hilbert space, entropy, entanglement).
- Efficient state simulation and visualization.
- JavaScript ES6 classes, DOM manipulation, and numerical methods.

### Run Instructions
Open `QuditSim.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox).  
Switch between **Exact** and **Summary** modes to explore scaling tradeoffs.
